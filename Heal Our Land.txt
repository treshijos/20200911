Heal Our Land by XXX 20200911

If my people will humble themselves
Humble themselves and pray
If they seek my face and humble themselves
And turn from their wicked ways
I will hear from heaven and forgive their sins
I will hear from heaven and heal their land
Lord, heal our land
Father, heal our land
Hear our cry and turn our nation back to You

Lord, heal our land
Hear us oh, Lord, and heal our land
Forgive our sin and heal our broken land
Lord, we vow our knee, we humble ourselves
Humble ourselves and pray

Lord, we seek your face and humble ourselves
And turn from my wicked ways
Father in Your mercy, forgive our sins
Father in Your mercy, come heal our land

Lord, heal our land
Father, heal our land
Hear our cry and turn our nation back to You
Lord, heal our land
Hear us oh, Lord, and heal our land
Forgive our sin and heal our broken land

Lord, heal our land
Father, heal our land
Hear our cry and turn our nation back to You
Lord, heal our land
Hear us oh, Lord, and heal our land
Forgive our sin and heal our broken land

Lord, heal our land
Father, heal our land
Hear our cry and heal our broken land
